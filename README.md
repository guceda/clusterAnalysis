[Udemy link](https://devo.udemy.com/course/cluster-analysis-unsupervised-machine-learning-python/learn/lecture/6627552#content)

## Clustering: 
  - K-means
  - Hierarchical 

## Gaussian Mixture Models: 
  - Density Estimation
  - Comparison with K-Means 


## Unsupervised Machine Learning: 

  #### Learning the structure or the probaility distribution of the data.
  - Specific examples: 
    - **Density estimation:** 
        - Given x1,x2,x3,... find the probability density distribution (PDF) p(x)
        - You can then generate new samples once you learn the distribution.
        - i.e. Generate a Shakespeare play
    - **Latent variables:**
        - Underlying cause
        - Missing or hidden data
        - e.g. You have a bunch of documents, and find distinc clusters
        - Clusters reveal romance novels, children's books, etc...
        - 'Topic modeling' (Z = topic -> X = words/document)
    - **Dimensionality reduction:** (UNSUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING COURSE )
      - Principal commponents analysis (PCA)
      - Singular value decomposition
    - **Visualization**
      - Simplify data to visualize (PCA to be able to plot in scatter);
      - Can tell us when an algorithm is not working


# Why use clustering

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (there are no labels in the data)
**   NLP course **

Better efficiency search
- Find cluster where it belongs
- Nearest neighbor search inside the cluster

# Easy introduction to kmeans clustering
